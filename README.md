# The Blockchain Data Structure

This repository contains information about various data structures in the Solidity programming language, used for smart contract development on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes detailed explanations and examples of commonly used data structures such as arrays, structs, and mappings, as well as more advanced concepts like inheritance and contract-level storage. The resources in this repository can be used as a reference for developers looking to improve their understanding of data structures in Solidity and gain a deeper understanding of how to write efficient and effective smart contracts.

## Key concepts and DataStructures :

- [bool](/default_workspace/contracts/ExampleBool.sol)
- [string](/default_workspace/contracts/ExampleString.sol)
- [address](/default_workspace/contracts/ExampleAddress.sol)
- [view and pure](/default_workspace/contracts/ExampleViewPure.sol)
- [wrapAround](/default_workspace/contracts/ExampleWrapAround.sol)
- [Example contact MsgSender](/default_workspace/contracts/ExampleMsgSender.sol)
- [The Bloackchain Messenger](/default_workspace/contracts/TheBlockchainMessenger.sol)

# The Blockchain Messenger Implementation

In this project, I have implement a simple messenger functionality in a Smart Contract. Make sue

1. Through the constructor make sure you write the address that deployed the contract to a variable
2. Create a message-variable of the type string, that only the deployer-address can update
3. Create a counter, to see how many times the variable was updated.
